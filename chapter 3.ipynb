The online appendix, “Number Systems,” discusses the binary number system. [Hint: Use the modulus and division operators to pick off the “binary” number’s digits one at a time from right to left. Just as in the decimal number system, where the rightmost digit has the positional value 1 and the next digit to the left has the positional value 10, then 100, then 1000, etc., in the binary number system, the rightmost digit has the positional value 1, the next digit to the left has the positional value 2, then 4, then 8, etc. Thus, the decimal number 234 can be interpreted as 2 * 100 + 3 * 10 + 4 * 1. The decimal equivalent of binary 1101 is 1 * 8 + 1 * 4 + 0 * 2 + 1 * 1.]"

    "3.27. **(World Population Growth)**World population has grown considerably over the centuries. Continued growth could eventually challenge the limits of breathable air, drinkable water, arable land and other limited resources. There’s evidence that growth has been slowing in recent years and that world population could peak some time this century, then start to decline. For this exercise, research world population growth issues. This is a controversial topic, so be sure to investigate various viewpoints. Get estimates for the current world population and its growth rate. Write a script that calculates world population growth each year for the next 100 years, using the simplifying assumption that the current growth rate will stay constant . Print the results in a table. The first column should display the year from 1 to 100. The second column should display the anticipated world population at the end of that year. The third column should display the numerical increase in the world population that would occur that year. Using your results, determine the years in which the population would be double and eventually quadruple what it is today."
